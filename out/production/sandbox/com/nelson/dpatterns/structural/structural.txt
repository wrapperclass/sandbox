In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying 
a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Structural patterns describe how objects and classes can be combined to form structures. We distinguish 
between object patterns and class patterns. The difference is that class patterns describe relationships 
and structures with the help of inheritance. Object patterns, on the other hand, describe how objects can
be associated and aggregated to form larger, more complex structures.
